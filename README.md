# Stathistical_Methods


This repository contains all the labs completed during the Statistical Methods course, along with the final project presented. 

The exercises are organized by topic and include the input files used for the analyses. 

The final project is a complete statistical research on a real dataset, including the problem description, data analysis, conclusions, and possible extensions. 

The repository is designed to be a study and reference tool for anyone interested in delving deeper into the statistical techniques covered in the course.
